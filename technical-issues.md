## Audio and Microphone Issues

At ItalianChat, we want your learning experience to be smooth and enjoyable. Sometimes, however, technology can throw us a curveball. Don't worry! Most audio and microphone issues are easily resolved. Let's walk through some common problems and their solutions.

### Audio Not Working?

If you're having trouble hearing your Italian lessons, try these simple steps:

1. Check your device's silent mode:

   - On iOS: Look for the silent switch on the side of your device
   - On Android: Check your quick settings panel for a mute icon

2. Adjust your volume:

   - Use the volume buttons on your device
   - Ensure the in-app volume isn't muted

3. For iOS devices (iPhone and iPad):
   - Go to Settings > Sounds & Haptics
   - Make sure the volume slider isn't all the way to the left
